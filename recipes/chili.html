    <h3>Introductions</h3>
    <p>Don’t be afraid to play! Like it spicer? Add red pepper flakes or Spicy Bush’s® Chili Beans. 
    Like it thicker? Feel free to cook this over the stove all day. (Just add water as needed for 
    best consistency.)</p>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, sauté the chopped onion, green bell pepper, and garlic in oil over medium-high heat. 
        I like to use grapeseed oil because it’s a little less oily. </li>
        <li>Add in the ground turkey or beef. Before the meat has completely cooked, add the tomato paste. 
        Finish browning the meat completely. </li>
        <li>Stir in the remaining ingredients, except the beans and the cheese. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat. 
        Cover and simmer on low heat for 30 minutes (or longer until the desired consistency is reached), 
        stirring occasionally. </li>
        <li>Then, 20 minutes before serving, add the beans. You can’t add the beans in right away or they get mushy.</li>
        <li>Finish with sharp cheddar cheese. Any leftovers are easy to freeze!</li>
    </ol>
