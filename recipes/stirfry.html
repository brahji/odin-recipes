    <h3>Introductions</h3>
    <p>This Chinese vegetable stir-fry is filled with meaty shiitake mushrooms, 
        crunchy broccoli, and sweet bell peppers in a gingery, garlicky brown sauce. 
        Go ahead and buy your veggies ready-cut if possible to minimize prep time.
        And, as with any stir-fry, be sure to have all of your ingredients ready before 
        you start cooking because it comes together quickly.</p>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk the soy sauce, water, dry sherry, sesame oil, sugar, 
        cornstarch, red pepper flakes and dry mustard together. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large nonstick skillet, bring 1 inch of water to a rapid boil. 
        Add the broccoli and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until tender-crisp.</li>
        <li>Strain the broccoli in a colander and then run under cold water to stop 
        the cooking process. Set aside and allow to fully drain.</li>
        <li>Wipe the skillet dry. Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and heat over high heat. 
        Add the shiitake mushrooms and red peppers and cook, stirring occasionally, 
        for 5-6 minutes, until the mushrooms are browned and the peppers are softened.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, white/light green scallions, and ginger; cook, stirring constantly, 
        until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Return the broccoli to the pan and cook until warmed through, about 1 minute. Add the reserved sauce.</li>
        <li>Toss and cook until the sauce is thickened and the vegetables are evenly coated, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Transfer to serving dish and sprinkle with dark green scallions. Serve with rice, if desired.</li>
